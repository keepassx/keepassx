    \class QLockFile
    \inmodule QtCore
    \brief The QLockFile class provides locking between processes using a file.
    \since 5.1

    A lock file can be used to prevent multiple processes from accessing concurrently
    the same resource. For instance, a configuration file on disk, or a socket, a port,
    a region of shared memory...

    Serialization is only guaranteed if all processes that access the shared resource
    use QLockFile, with the same file path.

    QLockFile supports two use cases:
    to protect a resource for a short-term operation (e.g. verifying if a configuration
    file has changed before saving new settings), and for long-lived protection of a
    resource (e.g. a document opened by a user in an editor) for an indefinite amount of time.

    When protecting for a short-term operation, it is acceptable to call lock() and wait
    until any running operation finishes.
    When protecting a resource over a long time, however, the application should always
    call setStaleLockTime(0) and then tryLock() with a short timeout, in order to
    warn the user that the resource is locked.

    If the process holding the lock crashes, the lock file stays on disk and can prevent
    any other process from accessing the shared resource, ever. For this reason, QLockFile
    tries to detect such a "stale" lock file, based on the process ID written into the file,
    and (in case that process ID got reused meanwhile), on the last modification time of
    the lock file (30s by default, for the use case of a short-lived operation).
    If the lock file is found to be stale, it will be deleted.

    For the use case of protecting a resource over a long time, you should therefore call
    setStaleLockTime(0), and when tryLock() returns LockFailedError, inform the user
    that the document is locked, possibly using getLockInfo() for more details.
*/

/*!
    \enum QLockFile::LockError

    This enum describes the result of the last call to lock() or tryLock().

    \value NoError The lock was acquired successfully.
    \value LockFailedError The lock could not be acquired because another process holds it.
    \value PermissionError The lock file could not be created, for lack of permissions
                           in the parent directory.
    \value UnknownError Another error happened, for instance a full partition
                        prevented writing out the lock file.

    Sets \a staleLockTime to be the time in milliseconds after which
    a lock file is considered stale.
    The default value is 30000, i.e. 30 seconds.
    If your application typically keeps the file locked for more than 30 seconds
    (for instance while saving megabytes of data for 2 minutes), you should set
    a bigger value using setStaleLockTime().

    The value of \a staleLockTime is used by lock() and tryLock() in order
    to determine when an existing lock file is considered stale, i.e. left over
    by a crashed process. This is useful for the case where the PID got reused
    meanwhile, so the only way to detect a stale lock file is by the fact that
    it has been around for a long time.

    Retrieves information about the current owner of the lock file.

    If tryLock() returns \c false, and error() returns LockFailedError,
    this function can be called to find out more information about the existing
    lock file:
    \list
    \li the PID of the application (returned in \a pid)
    \li the \a hostname it's running on (useful in case of networked filesystems),
    \li the name of the application which created it (returned in \a appname),
    \endlist

    Note that tryLock() automatically deleted the file if there is no
    running application with this PID, so LockFailedError can only happen if there is
    an application with this PID (it could be unrelated though).

    This can be used to inform users about the existing lock file and give them
    the choice to delete it. After removing the file using removeStaleLockFile(),
    the application can call tryLock() again.

    This function returns \c true if the information could be successfully retrieved, false
    if the lock file doesn't exist or doesn't contain the expected data.
    This can happen if the lock file was deleted between the time where tryLock() failed
    and the call to this function. Simply call tryLock() again if this happens.
