    <p>
      KeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you to
      manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one
      database, which is locked with one master key or a key-disk. So you only have
      to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the
      whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure
      encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).
