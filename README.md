# KeePassX

## About

KeePassX is a password manager for people with extremely high demands on security.
It is light weight, cross platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Along with passwords, each entry in KeePassX can include associated usernames, urls, an attachement and comments.
Entries can be grouped and labeled with user-defined titles and icons to simplify organization.
The search function helps find passwords, and it can be limited to single groups.
And generating new passwords is, easy with the customizable password generator.

KeePassX uses a database format that is compatible with [KeePass Password Safe](http://keepass.info/).
The database is encrypted with the AES block cipher using a 256 bit key.
