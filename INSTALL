Building KeePassX 2 on (64-bit) OSX:
====================================
Install dependencies and cmake via homebrew (or macports)

Qt can also be installed using the official binary installer
(tested with Qt 5.2.1 and 5.5.1_2, should work with other versions)

If you want to build universal with -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="i386;x86_64" 
install the required Qt and dependencies

Example for homebrew:
$ brew install libgcrypt

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5 ..
(tested with Qt 5.2.1 and 5.5.1_2, should work with other versions)

$ make -j3
$ /usr/local/opt/qt5/bin/macdeployqt src/KeePassX.app/
$ make test

Then:

$ make install # to install to /Applications
or
$ make package # to create a .dmg in the src dir
